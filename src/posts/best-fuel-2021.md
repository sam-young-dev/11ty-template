They’re a sweet—but not too sweet—treat that will help you bounce back from your hardest workouts, both body and mind. Definitely don’t skip the dark chocolate mint flavor.

Did we mention these bars are soft and delicious? We love the earthy-tangy combination of the Red Beets and Orange flavor.

The Canaberry flavor is made with real foods like basmati rice, bananas, strawberries, maple syrup, and coconut water, so it goes down easy, tastes like a smoothie, and provides sustained energy without the spike and crash of additives like maltodextrin.
